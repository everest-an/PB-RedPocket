Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\n external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\n function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\n The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\n reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\n case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\n For example:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```solidity\n contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\n     function initialize() initializer public {\n         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");\n     }\n }\n contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\n     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\n         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");\n     }\n }\n ```\n TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\n possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\n CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\n that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\n [CAUTION]\n ====\n Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\n An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\n contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke\n the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:\n [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\n ```\n /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n constructor() {\n     _disableInitializers();\n }\n ```\n

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```solidity contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"errors\":{\"InvalidInitialization()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is already initialized.\"}],\"NotInitializing()\":[{\"details\":\"The contract is not initializing.\"}]},\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint64)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xdb4d24ee2c087c391d587cd17adfe5b3f9d93b3110b1388c2ab6c7c0ad1dcd05\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ab7b6d5b9e2b88176312967fe0f0e78f3d9a1422fa5e4b64e2440c35869b5d08\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmXKYWWyzcLg1B2k7Sb1qkEXgLCYfXecR9wYW5obRzWP1Q\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol":{"UUPSUpgradeable":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"target","type":"address"}],"name":"AddressEmptyCode","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"implementation","type":"address"}],"name":"ERC1967InvalidImplementation","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"ERC1967NonPayable","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"FailedCall","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"UUPSUnauthorizedCallContext","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"bytes32","name":"slot","type":"bytes32"}],"name":"UUPSUnsupportedProxiableUUID","type":"error"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"implementation","type":"address"}],"name":"Upgraded","type":"event"},{"inputs":[],"name":"UPGRADE_INTERFACE_VERSION","outputs":[{"internalType":"string","name":"","type":"string"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[],"name":"proxiableUUID","outputs":[{"internalType":"bytes32","name":"","type":"bytes32"}],"stateMutability":"view","type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"newImplementation","type":"address"},{"internalType":"bytes","name":"data","type":"bytes"}],"name":"upgradeToAndCall","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"payable","type":"function"}],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"","opcodes":"","sourceMap":""},"methodIdentifiers":{"UPGRADE_INTERFACE_VERSION()":"ad3cb1cc","proxiableUUID()":"52d1902d","upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes)":"4f1ef286"}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.24+commit.e11b9ed9\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"target\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"AddressEmptyCode\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"implementation\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"ERC1967InvalidImplementation\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"ERC1967NonPayable\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"FailedCall\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"UUPSUnauthorizedCallContext\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes32\",\"name\":\"slot\",\"type\":\"bytes32\"}],\"name\":\"UUPSUnsupportedProxiableUUID\",\"type\":\"error\"},{\"anonymous\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"indexed\":true,\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"implementation\",\"type\":\"address\"}],\"name\":\"Upgraded\",\"type\":\"event\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"UPGRADE_INTERFACE_VERSION\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"string\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"string\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"proxiableUUID\",\"outputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"bytes32\",\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"bytes32\"}],\"stateMutability\":\"view\",\"type\":\"function\"},{\"inputs\":[{\"internalType\":\"address\",\"name\":\"newImplementation\",\"type\":\"address\"},{\"internalType\":\"bytes\",\"name\":\"data\",\"type\":\"bytes\"}],\"name\":\"upgradeToAndCall\",\"outputs\":[],\"stateMutability\":\"payable\",\"type\":\"function\"}],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"An upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies.
